# Provider Lessons: Sandbox

### Provider map path regex must allow digits in provider names
**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Context:** Adding `k8s-pod` to sandbox providers caused provider-map.test.ts and phase2.test.ts to fail — their path validation regex was `[a-z-]+` which doesn't match digits.
**Lesson:** When adding providers with digits in their names (e.g., `k8s-pod`), update path validation regexes from `[a-z-]+` to `[a-z0-9-]+` in provider-map.test.ts and phase2.test.ts.

### Mock k8s client-node with class syntax, not vi.fn().mockImplementation()
**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Context:** Mocking `@kubernetes/client-node` with `vi.fn().mockImplementation(...)` for `KubeConfig` failed with "is not a constructor" when used with dynamic `import()`.
**Lesson:** Use actual class definitions (`class MockKubeConfig { ... }`) in `vi.mock()` factories instead of `vi.fn().mockImplementation()` when mocking constructors that will be used with `new`.

### child.killed is true after ANY kill() call, not just after the process is dead
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Context:** `enforceTimeout` was checking `child.killed` to skip SIGKILL after SIGTERM, but `child.killed` is set to `true` the moment `kill()` is called, regardless of whether the process actually exited.
**Lesson:** Use a custom `exited` flag set via `child.on('exit', ...)` to track whether the process has actually terminated. Don't rely on `child.killed` to mean "the process is dead" — it only means "we've called kill() on it".

### Never use tsx binary as a process wrapper — use `node --import tsx/esm` instead
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Context:** Diagnosing agent delegation failures — tsx wrapper caused EPERM, orphaned processes, and corrupted exit codes
**Lesson:** The tsx binary (`node_modules/.bin/tsx`) spawns a child Node.js process and relays signals via `relaySignalToChild`. On macOS, this relay fails with EPERM, and tsx has no error handling for it. Always use `node --import <absolute-path-to-tsx/dist/esm/index.mjs>` instead — single process, no signal relay issues. The absolute path is mandatory because agents run with cwd=workspace (temp dir with no node_modules).
