# Providers: Memory

Memory provider implementations, MemoryFS planning.

## [2026-03-02 16:04] — Add MemoryFS v2 core types (Task 1 of 10)

**Task:** Create the core types module for the MemoryFS provider
**What I did:** Created types.ts with six memory types (profile, event, knowledge, behavior, skill, tool), MemoryFSItem interface, MemoryFSConfig interface, RefId type alias, and DEFAULT_CATEGORIES constant. Wrote test file first (TDD), verified failure, then implemented.
**Files touched:** src/providers/memory/memoryfs/types.ts (new), tests/providers/memory/memoryfs/types.test.ts (new)
**Outcome:** Success — all 3 tests pass
**Notes:** LLMProvider imported from ../../llm/types.js. This is the foundation for the remaining 9 tasks in the MemoryFS v2 plan.

## [2026-03-01 19:30] — Create MemoryFS implementation plan

**Task:** Review memory-proposal.md and memory-feedback.md, create a detailed implementation plan
**What I did:** Explored the full codebase to understand provider patterns, existing memory providers, IPC schemas, SQLite utilities, and test conventions. Synthesized both source documents into a 16-task, 5-phase implementation plan covering storage foundation, core memory path, git integration, organization/lifecycle, deep retrieval, proactive intelligence, and integration testing.
**Files touched:** docs/plans/2026-03-01-memoryfs-implementation.md (new)
**Outcome:** Success — plan created, committed, and pushed
**Notes:** Plan follows the writing-plans skill format with TDD steps per task. Incorporated all feedback recommendations: two-phase writes, reconciler, tiered decay (hot/warm/cold), manifest-backed categories, git history worker, fact fingerprinting, idempotency, sensitivity fields.
