# Heartbeat Checklist

<!--
  This file controls what you check on each heartbeat tick.
  Each item has a cadence (how often to run) and a description.
  On each heartbeat, review the list, check items that are overdue,
  and respond HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing needs attention.
  Keep this concise — 5-10 items max. Heartbeats run frequently.

## Checks

- **memory-review** (every 4h): Review recent memories for patterns worth consolidating
- **pending-tasks** (every 1h): Check if there are any pending tasks or queued identity changes awaiting review
