<p align="center"><strong>Always-on AI agents that act autonomously</strong></p>

---

AX is a **personal AI agent** that lets you message an AI assistant (via CLI, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) and have it take actions on your behalf — read emails, fetch web pages, control a browser, manage your calendar, remember your preferences.

Sound familiar? It should. **OpenClaw** proved that AI agents can be genuinely useful. The problem is that OpenClaw also proved what happens when you don't think about security until it's too late: ~173k lines of code nobody can audit, 42,665 exposed instances on Shodan, a remote code execution CVE, and 341 malicious skills in its marketplace.

We love what OpenClaw does. We just couldn't sleep at night running it.

AX gives you the same power — **multi-channel messaging, web access, browser automation, long-term memory, extensible skills** — but with security guardrails that are actually enforced by the architecture, not just by good intentions. And at ~13,500 lines of code, it's still small enough to audit in a weekend.

The best part? **You decide where you sit on the spectrum.** Lock everything down, open everything up, or land somewhere in the middle. We give you the dial. We just make sure the safety net is always there, even when you crank it to 11.

## Architecture

We use a **provider contract pattern** — every subsystem (LLM, memory, scanner, channels, etc.) is a TypeScript interface with pluggable implementations. The host process is trusted. Agent containers are not. That's not rude, it's just good security.

### Trust Zones

| Zone | Trust Level | Isolation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Host Process** | Fully trusted | Runs on your machine |
| **Agent Container** | Untrusted | No network, no credentials, no host filesystem |
| **Browser Container** | Untrusted | Filtered egress only |

### Architectural Invariants

A few things are non-negotiable regardless of which profile you choose. These are **enforced by the architecture** and can't be weakened by configuration:

- Agent containers have **no network access**. All external communication goes through the host's IPC proxy.
- Credentials **never** enter containers. API keys are injected server-side. The agent can use them, but it can never see them.
- All external content is **taint-tagged**. Emails, web pages, anything from outside gets labeled and tracked.
- Every action is **audited**. Containers cannot modify the audit log.
- The agent **cannot modify its own sandbox**.
- **No web UI**. OpenClaw's dashboard was its #1 attack vector, so we solved that problem by not having one.

### Sandbox Tiers

| Platform | Default | Escalation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Linux | nsjail (~5ms start) | Docker + gVisor |
| macOS | Seatbelt (sandbox-exec) | Docker Desktop |

We start with the lightest sandbox that does the job. If the agent needs heavier tools, we escalate mid-session. Most invocations never need more than nsjail — it starts in 5 milliseconds and uses about 1MB of memory.

## Security Profiles

This is the dial. You pick where you want to be:

| Profile | What it's for | Taint Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Paranoid** (default) | Maximum safety. Web disabled, no OAuth, read-only skills. | 10% |
| **Standard** | The sweet spot for most people. Web access with blocklists, scheduled tasks, skill proposals with review. | 30% |
| **Power User** | Full capability. Unrestricted web, read-write OAuth, browser automation, multi-agent delegation. You know the risks. | 60% |

The taint threshold controls when we pause to ask before doing something sensitive (like sending an email) based on how much external content is in the conversation. Higher threshold = more autonomy. All three profiles keep the architectural invariants intact — the agent never gets network access or raw credentials, no matter what.

We default to Paranoid not because we think you need it, but because we think defaults should be safe. Upgrading to Standard or Power User is one line in `ax.yaml`.

## What's In the Box

### Multi-Provider LLM Support

AX isn't locked to one AI provider. Configure any combination of Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible API using compound model IDs:

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
model_fallbacks:
  - groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile
  - openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
```

The **LLM router** handles failover automatically — if your primary model hits a rate limit or goes down, AX falls back to the next candidate with exponential backoff. You set the preference order; we handle the rest.

### Conversation History

AX remembers. A SQLite-backed conversation store persists turns across restarts, so your agent picks up where it left off. Configure how much context to carry:

```yaml
history:
  max_turns: 100
  thread_context_turns: 20
```

### Scheduling

Your agent can act on its own schedule, not just when you message it:

- **Cron jobs** — recurring tasks with standard 5-field cron syntax ("check my email every morning at 9am")
- **One-shot scheduling** — "remind me about this in 2 hours" via `scheduler_run_at`
- **Heartbeat** — periodic check-ins where the agent reviews overdue items and takes action

Scheduled responses route back through the outbound delivery pipeline to the right channel — Slack, CLI, wherever you're listening.

### Slack Integration

Full Slack support via Socket Mode:

- **Thread-aware sessions** — conversations stay in-thread, context preserved
- **Smart reply gating** — in channels, the agent only responds when mentioned or directly addressed (no spam)
- **Eyes emoji** — visual acknowledgment while the agent processes your message
- **Thread history backfill** — agent loads thread context before replying
- **DM and group DM support** — works everywhere Slack does

### Skill Self-Authoring

Agents can propose their own skills — persistent markdown instructions that expand their capabilities. Proposals go through safety screening: dangerous patterns are hard-rejected, capability-expanding patterns require human review, and clean content is auto-approved. You stay in the loop on anything that matters.

### Config Hot Reload

Change `ax.yaml` and AX picks it up live — no restart required. Send `SIGHUP` or just save the file. New config is validated before the old server tears down, so a typo won't take you offline.

### Modular System Prompts

The agent's system prompt is assembled from composable modules — identity, security, injection defense, skills, context, runtime, heartbeat, and reply gating. Each module is independently testable with token budget tracking, so the prompt stays within limits even as capabilities grow.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your API key (don't worry, it never enters the sandbox)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Run AX
npm start

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Configuration

Edit `ax.yaml` to configure providers, security profile, and sandbox settings. The defaults are conservative — we'd rather you opt into power than accidentally leave the door open. But opting in is easy, and we won't judge.

```yaml
profile: paranoid
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
providers:
  memory: file
  scanner: basic
  channels: []
  web: none
  browser: none
  credentials: env
  skills: readonly
  audit: file
  sandbox: subprocess
  scheduler: none
```

## Contributing

We'd love your help. Before diving in, please read through these so we're all on the same page:

1. Read the [PRP](docs/plans/ax-prp.md) for our design philosophy (the "why")
2. Read the [architecture doc](docs/plans/ax-architecture-doc.md) for implementation details (the "how")
3. Read the [security spec](docs/plans/ax-security-hardening-spec.md) for security requirements (the "or else")
4. Providers live in category subdirectories: `src/providers/llm/anthropic.ts`, `src/providers/channel/slack.ts`, etc.
5. All file path construction must use `safePath()` from `src/utils/safe-path.ts` — no raw `path.join()` with untrusted input
6. All IPC actions must have Zod schemas with `.strict()` mode — no unknown fields sneaking through
