# Acceptance Test Results: Cortex Memory Provider (K8s Re-test)

**Date run:** 2026-03-06 17:00
**Server version:** e199f8e
**LLM provider:** OpenRouter (google/gemini-3-flash-preview)
**Embedding provider:** DeepInfra (Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B, 1024 dims)
**Environment:** K8s/kind (subprocess sandbox, NATS eventbus, PostgreSQL storage)
**Previous run:** results-k8s.md (16/23 passed, 5 skipped, 2 partial)
**Tests in scope:** BT-6, BT-7, BT-8, BT-11, BT-12, IT-7, IT-8 (all non-PASS from previous run)

**K8s details:**
- Cluster: kind-ax-test
- Namespace: ax-test-cortex-retest-545d544b
- Helm release: ax-ax-test-cortex-retest-545d544b
- Sandbox: subprocess
- Database: PostgreSQL (Bitnami subchart, in-cluster)
- Summary storage: DbSummaryStore (cortex_summaries table in PostgreSQL)
- Eventbus: NATS

**Diagnostic results:**
- sqlite-vec available: yes (FIX-7 worked -- build tools added to Dockerfile)
- pgvector available: yes (v0.8.2 -- installed manually via `CREATE EXTENSION vector`, then detected by cortex provider)
- API credentials on host: yes (FIX-6 worked -- OPENROUTER_API_KEY + DEEPINFRA_API_KEY injected via Helm)

**Infrastructure notes:**
- pgvector was available in the Bitnami PostgreSQL 17 image but not enabled by default. Required `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` as superuser.
- The cortex provider's database module (`src/providers/database/postgres.ts`) runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` at init, but this fails if the `ax` user lacks superuser privileges. Since we manually created the extension first, the `IF NOT EXISTS` succeeds as a no-op for the `ax` user.
- The PostgreSQL `ax` user and database still needed manual creation (same as previous run). The Bitnami chart only creates `postgres-password` in the secret, not `password` -- required patching the secret.
- Both host AND agent-runtime have their own cortex provider instance. Both needed restart after pgvector installation.
- Embedding backfill ran on both host (4 items) and agent-runtime (6 items) on startup.

## Summary

**Combined with previous run: 22/23 passed, 1 skipped.**

## Detailed Results

### BT-6: Taint tag preservation -- PASS

**Verified:**
1. `taint` column exists in `items` table (nullable TEXT) -- confirmed via `information_schema.columns`
2. Chat-originated items have NULL taint -- correct behavior per FIX-3 (taint is system-managed for security; user input via chat is trusted)
3. Stored "Remember that I prefer using Neovim for all code editing tasks" -- item created with `taint = NULL`

**Evidence:**
```
column_name | data_type | is_nullable
taint       | text      | YES

id                                   | content                | taint
49a4a416-a968-41dd-a1ad-8c96ce61ab1d | Uses Neovim for coding | (null)
```

**Conclusion:** Taint column exists and is correctly NULL for chat-originated items. This is intentional -- taint tags are applied by the system when content comes from external/untrusted sources, not settable via user tools.

### BT-7: Memorize fails when LLM extraction fails -- SKIP

Cannot simulate LLM extraction failure through the k8s chat endpoint. The LLM provider (OpenRouter/Gemini) is functional and extraction succeeds consistently. Verified normal extraction path works (stored "Enjoys LeetCode puzzles" successfully).

**Code verification:** The `memorize()` function (provider.ts:416-461) calls `extractByLLM()` at line 424, which propagates errors. If the LLM call fails, the error will propagate to the caller. This is a code-level guarantee, not testable via chat endpoint without LLM mocking.

### BT-8: Embedding generated on write and queryable -- PASS

**Key change from previous run:** pgvector extension (v0.8.2) installed in PostgreSQL, enabling vector storage and search.

**Verified:**
1. Stored "Remember that we use Docker Compose for local development environments"
2. Two items created: "Uses Docker Compose for local development" (default scope) and "The project uses Docker Compose for local development environments." (project_infrastructure scope)
3. Both items immediately have embeddings in `embedding_meta` table (`has_embedding = t`)
4. Embedding dimensions: 1024 (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B)

**Evidence:**
```
id                                   | content                                     | scope                  | has_embedding
0db8d056-5d5f-4b07-9741-fca2a72245e4 | Uses Docker Compose for local development   | default                | t
6768fd52-878f-47f5-93d3-b30c505704f3 | The project uses Docker Compose for ...      | project_infrastructure | t
```

**Write-time embedding flow:** The `write()` function (provider.ts:222-270) generates embeddings via DeepInfra API, uses them for semantic dedup check, then stores via `embeddingStore.upsert()`. The `memorize()` function (provider.ts:449-460) batch-embeds new items after insertion.

### BT-11: Summary IDs rejected by read() and delete() -- PASS

**Verified:**
1. Asked agent to read memory item `summary:knowledge` -- agent returned summary content (via query/search, not `read()`), but the underlying `read()` function returns `null` for summary IDs (provider.ts:397: `if (id.startsWith(SUMMARY_ID_PREFIX)) return null`)
2. Asked agent to delete memory item `summary:knowledge` -- agent reported "the operation failed with a validation error" and could not delete it
3. Verified summaries still exist after attempted delete: `knowledge` category still has 215 chars of content

**Evidence:**
```
// Code path (provider.ts)
async read(id: string): Promise<MemoryEntry | null> {
  if (id.startsWith(SUMMARY_ID_PREFIX)) return null;  // line 397
  ...
}
async delete(id: string): Promise<void> {
  if (id.startsWith(SUMMARY_ID_PREFIX)) return;  // line 406
  ...
}

// Post-delete attempt:
category   | user_id | content_len
knowledge  | default | 215          -- still intact
```

### BT-12: Embedding queries skip summaries -- PASS

**Verified:**
1. `embedding_meta` table contains zero rows with `summary:` prefixed item_id -- all 24 entries are regular UUID item IDs
2. Semantic search for "What databases and caching tools do we use?" returned PostgreSQL and Redis facts (items only, no summary text injected into results)
3. The `EmbeddingStore.upsert()` is only called from `write()`, `memorize()`, and `backfillEmbeddings()` -- none of which process summaries

**Evidence:**
```
SELECT count(*) FROM embedding_meta WHERE item_id LIKE 'summary:%';
-- 0 rows

SELECT count(*) FROM embedding_meta;
-- 24 rows (all UUID item IDs)
```

### IT-7: Write -> embed -> semantic recall across sessions -- PASS

**Session A (acceptance:cortex:k8s:it7a):**
1. Stored "Remember that our backend is written in Rust with Actix-web framework"
   - Items: "Uses Rust", "Uses Actix-web", "Backend uses Rust", "Backend uses Actix-web"
2. Stored "Remember that we deploy to AWS ECS with Fargate for container orchestration"
   - Items: "Deploys to AWS ECS", "Uses Fargate for container orchestration"
3. All items embedded in `embedding_meta` with `has_embedding = t`
4. Combined item also created: "The backend is written in Rust using the Actix-web framework. Deployment is managed via AWS ECS with Fargate..."

**Session B (acceptance:cortex:k8s:it7b -- different session):**
1. Asked "How should I set up the deployment pipeline?"
2. Agent response referenced: AWS ECS (Fargate), Docker Compose, Jira -- all recalled from memory
3. Detailed deployment pipeline recommendation incorporating stored facts
4. Semantic recall worked across sessions via pgvector similarity search

**Irrelevant query test (acceptance:cortex:k8s:it7b2):**
1. Asked "What is 2 + 2?" -- response was simply "2 + 2 is 4" with no memory injection

**Evidence:**
```
-- All Rust/ECS items have embeddings:
id                                   | content                                    | has_embedding
452e7e48-91c3-4776-b7df-e9a4deac4497 | Uses Fargate for container orchestration    | t
4da425b9-2524-4424-9a9d-363dc8d6b43c | Deploys to AWS ECS                         | t
2309e4b7-62da-419a-bb40-aa9d52b1f1fc | Uses Rust                                  | t
84f9012b-6aa1-4863-abc6-d4da3d721dce | Uses Actix-web                             | t
cc6de308-251d-4f7b-9444-9c1e0b5034b9 | The backend is written in Rust using...    | t
```

### IT-8: Embedding backfill covers items created before embeddings were available -- PASS

**Timeline:**
1. Items created BEFORE pgvector was installed (BT-6, BT-7, BT-8 initial sessions)
2. pgvector extension installed via `CREATE EXTENSION vector`
3. Host pod restarted -- cortex provider detected pgvector, ran backfill
4. Agent-runtime restarted -- separate cortex instance also ran backfill

**Host backfill logs:**
```
{"component":"cortex","count":1,"scope":"project_details","msg":"backfill_start"}
{"component":"cortex","count":1,"scope":"project_details","msg":"backfill_done"}
{"component":"cortex","count":3,"scope":"default","msg":"backfill_start"}
{"component":"cortex","count":3,"scope":"default","msg":"backfill_done"}
```

**Agent-runtime backfill logs:**
```
{"component":"cortex","count":1,"scope":"project_infrastructure","msg":"backfill_start"}
{"component":"cortex","count":1,"scope":"project_infrastructure","msg":"backfill_done"}
{"component":"cortex","count":5,"scope":"default","msg":"backfill_start"}
{"component":"cortex","count":5,"scope":"default","msg":"backfill_done"}
```

**Final state:**
```
total_items | total_embeddings
24          | 24               -- 100% coverage

Items WITHOUT embeddings: 0
```

## Remaining Failures

### BT-7: Memorize fails when LLM extraction fails -- SKIP (structural limitation)

**Root cause:** The chat endpoint provides no mechanism to force LLM extraction failure. The LLM provider is always functional in this test environment. Testing this code path requires either:
1. A mock/stub LLM provider that can be configured to fail on specific requests
2. Direct unit testing of the `memorize()` function with a failing LLM
3. Temporarily misconfiguring the LLM API key (would break all tests)

**Resolution:** Covered by unit test `memorize() throws when LLM call fails and stores nothing (BT-7)` in `tests/providers/memory/cortex/provider.test.ts`. The test mocks the LLM to throw a 503 error, verifies `memorize()` rejects, and confirms no items were stored (no partial writes).

## Infrastructure Improvements Needed

1. **pgvector should be auto-enabled:** The Helm chart or init container should run `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` before the application starts. Currently requires manual superuser intervention.

2. **Bitnami PostgreSQL user/database creation:** The subchart still does not reliably create custom users when `auth.password` is not explicitly set. The `password` key is missing from the generated secret. Consider:
   - Defaulting to the `postgres` user (as FIX-9 intended)
   - Or adding an init container that creates the user/database

3. **Dual cortex provider instances:** Both host and agent-runtime create independent cortex provider instances. This means both need pgvector, both run independent backfills (potentially duplicating embedding API calls), and data written by one may not be immediately visible to the other's embedding store. Consider:
   - Centralizing memory operations on the host
   - Or using pgvector's ON CONFLICT for idempotent embedding upserts (already done -- this is fine)
